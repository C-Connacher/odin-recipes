    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <OL>
            <li>On a skillet over hight heat, toast dried chiles for 
                2 min on each side. Remove from heat and remove stems
                 and seeds. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with 
                 1 Cup of boiling water. Let them hydrate for 5 min.
            </li>
            <li>Reserving the water, add the hydrated chiles, onion, 
                vinegar, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt to a blender.
                 Add 1/2 Cup of the reserved chile water. Blend until sauce 
                 is puree.
            </li>
            <li>Place oven rack 6 inches from the top burner and preheat 
                broiler on high. Place chicken thighs in cast iron skillet, 
                and pour over the chile sauce, stir to combine. Once hot, broil 
                chicken on the top rack for 15-20min, or until tops are just 
                beginning to blacken. 
            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and chop chicken into small pieces. In a bowl, 
                dress them with 1/4 Cup chile sauce from the pan and toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. 
                Add chicken, stirring frequently for about 5 min. Add the remaining 
                chile sauce to the skillet, toss, and remove from heat while you 
                warm tortillas.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately on warmed tortillas with your favorite toppings!
                 My favorite is chopped white onion, cilantro, and a hint of fresh lime!
            </li>
